## [v0.2.1] — 2024-12-15

  [v0.2.1]: https://github.com/theory/sqljson/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

### 📚 Documentation

*   Updated the playground links in the README to the new URL.
*   Added a couple of missing playground links to the README.

## [v0.2.0] — 2024-12-15

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Replaced the `ToString` method from the `DateTime` interface with
    `fmt.Stringer`. This complies with [a change] made just before the release
    of PostgreSQL 17 in order to keep the jsonpath functions immutable. The
    upshot is that time zones no longer impact the output of the `.string()`
    method.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Synced an [error message change] from PostgreSQL, changing `bool` to
    `boolean`.

### 📚 Documentation

*   PostgreSQL's implementation is also no longer impacted by the `DateStyle`
    GUC, so the paragraph about the lack of support for that feature has been
    removed from the `Compatibility` section of the `README`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Added a utility to help examine changes in the PostgreSQL repository when
    syncing changes.

## [v0.1.1] — 2024-09-19

### 📚 Documentation

*   Fixed broken links in the `README`
*   Added Playground links for all the examples in the `README`
*   Moved discussion of the difference from the PostgreSQL `DateStyle`
    parameter to the `Compatibility` section of the `README`
*   Added notes on the variable handling of identifiers with some Unicode code
    points to the `Compatibility` section of the `README`

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed failing tests comparing IDs generated by the `.keyvalue()` method
    due to differences between compile time and runtime.
